# Complexity-Project
This git-repo contains the Python files needed to get the plots and insight into crime spreading inside a continuous automaton. For the transition function, we assume that neighborhoods with high crime negatively impact neighboring neighborhoods and vice versa. The emergence of a giant component with various parameters is investigated and the impact of police on it. There is also research conducted into the possibility of the system having Self-organized criticality. 

### Purpose of the Research
STUKKIE OVER HYPOTHESE EN WRM WE DIT DOEN>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

### Data
The transition function is based on  ........ Please keep in mind that crime data in general have biases!

### Files
All files in the root are executables. In the modules function helper functions are placed which are used by the executables. The exploration folder contains files used to explore the system but are not used in the final plots. These files can be handy to better understand the system. These are not maintained. In the root is also a slide deck with info about our system. 

### Conclusions
HIER CONCLUSIE!!!
